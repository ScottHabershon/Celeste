About Celeste
=============

``Celeste`` is a python package which implements a set of computational methods which are aimed
at automated discovery and characterization of chemical reaction mechanisms. This python package
is an evolution of the original Fortran code used in the Habershon group.

Ultimately, ``Celeste`` will implement the following methods:

* Minimum-energy path (MEP) calculations, such as nudged elastic band (NEB) and Growing string method;
* Double-ended graph-driven mechanism finding;
* Single-ended graph-driven reaction network generation;
