Welcome to Celeste's documentation!
===================================

``Celeste`` is a chemical reaction-mechanism discovery code developed by the group of Prof. Scott Habershon
in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, UK.

This documentation provides examples of how to run ``Celeste``, typical input file structures, and notes on
output files.

In addition, API documentation for the ``Celeste`` python package is included - this also contains lots of useful
information about the code too.
