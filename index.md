Celeste is a chemical reaction-discovery code, developed in the group of Prof. Scott Habershon in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, UK.

Following several [recent publications](https://github.com/ScottHabershon/Celeste/edit/gh-pages/publications.md) on graph-driven reaction discovery, we're writing a usable python-based version of our original Fortran codes.

At the moment, a simple nudged elastic band (NEB) code is implemented; we're currently busy porting across a range of graph-driven reaction discovery methods.
