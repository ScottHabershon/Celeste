# Celeste
Celeste - chemical reaction discovery code

Celeste is a new code which implements several useful methods to perform automated chemical reaction-discovery simulations.

In the initial version of Celeste, a simple NEB calculation is implemented; ultimately, this code will also implement graph-based mechanism discovery methods 
recently developed in the Habershon group at the University of Warwick.
